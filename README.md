# tetris-sound
Reads a NES Tetris video and adds only the Tetris sound effect.

Use the file dialog to select the video file, and press "Go to pixel selection..."

In that screen you should select (by clicking on it) which pixel gets bright when a Tetris happen. You can go forward pressing the 'n' key. After selecting press 'q' to close this window.

The app will then fast forward throught the game finding the timestamps with tetrises, in the end you should have a video_with_tetris_sound_effect.mp4 with a copy of the video and the audio track containing only the tetris sound.
